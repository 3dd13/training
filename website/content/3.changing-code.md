## changing code

Let's make a small change to the code and reload the transaction processor.

This demonstrates how to edit code in development and check your changes against the running validator.

Open the `code/xo/src/tp/index.js` file.

> **TIP** you will need to use the `Editor` button on Play with Docker to edit files.

At the bottom of the file you will notice the section that starts the transaction processor as follows.

```javascript
// start the transactionProcessor - this will initiate and register the
// transaction processor with the validator
transactionProcessor.start()
```

Let's add a `console.log()` line just before the `transactionProcessor.start()` that will print a message just before the transaction processor attempts to connect to the validator.

Copy the following code and paste it just before the `transactionProcessor.start()` line:

```js
console.log(`OUR MESSAGE: connecting to validator: ${args.validator}`)
```

Here is how the change should look:

**BEFORE**

```js
// start the transactionProcessor - this will initiate and register the
// transaction processor with the validator
transactionProcessor.start()
```

**AFTER**

```js
// start the transactionProcessor - this will initiate and register the
// transaction processor with the validator
console.log(`OUR MESSAGE: connecting to validator: ${args.validator}`)
transactionProcessor.start()
```

Then click the `SAVE` button and close the editor which will return you to the main Play with Docker window.

## stopping and restarting the transaction processor

We have changed the code for our transaction processor, but the old version is still running.

We will need to restart the transaction processor for our changes to be applied.

First - let's kill the xo transaction processor container:

```bash
docker-compose stop xo-tp
```

Then restart it with the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d xo-tp
```

And check the logs of the xo transaction processor:

```bash
docker logs sawtooth-xo-tp
```

Great! We are now able to edit code and quickly re-run the transaction processor to see the changes we made running against the validator.

## recap

We just did the following things:

 * booted a sawtooth validator using docker-compose
 * started the xo transaction processor inside a container
 * stopped the xo transaction processor
 * changed some code on our laptop using a text editor
 * restarted the xo transaction processor
 * saw that our code printed a new line of logs

## advanced exercise

Look through the code for the xo transaction processor (this lives in `code/xo/src/tp`) - we will be diving deeper into this shortly.
