## Let's play a game!

Now that we have a running xo transaction processor - let's play a game of XO!

We have a nice browser UI that communicates with the transaction processor.

In Play with Docker, you will need to click the button at the top of your screen for port 8081:

![xo-ports](/images/screens/xo-ports.png "xo-ports")

## Create a game

Click `Create` and name your game.

> Notice how when the game is created - the transaction processor will produce some logs

## Play the game

Play the game by clicking around.

> Notice how the transaction processor is printing the status of the game as you play by following it's logs: `docker logs -f sawtooth-xo-tp`

## Create an error

Try clicking on a space that is already taken.

> Notice how the transaction processor will reject the transaction and the message is displayed in both the logs of the transaction processor and the UI

## Play multiplayer

Let's try some multiplayer action!

The address of your game is the URL when you click on the `8081` button within Play with Docker.  You can share the address on the group chat.

Play some games multiplayer!

> Notice how you cannot move if it's not your turn

## advanced exercise

Half way through a game, generate new keys using the `keys` menu and submit a new move using those keys.  Notice how the move is invalid because the player is now using a different key.
