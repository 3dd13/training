title: Update XO

We will now make some changes to the XO transaction processor and CLI.

In the `Application Development Best Practices` section - the trainer should have gone over the concepts surrounding Sawtooth transaction processors and clients.

It's now time to put some of these concepts into practice by making changes to our beloved XO transaction family!

## ideas

Here are some ideas for you to consider:

### improve error messages

There is scope for throwing additional error messages.  For example, if a player is not allowed to play because their key is not one the existing players.

### fix play yourself

Presently it's possible to play a game where both players use the same key.

Prevent this from happening by throwing an error if the player2 key is the same as the player1 key.

### collaborative XO

Change the transaction processor so that a key can only occupy a single space.

This means that many players play a single game - each choosing their single move.

### cheat game

Add a new transaction type called `autowin` that immediately wins the game for that player.

### reset game

Add a new transaction type called `reset` that wipes the board but keeps the game.

### lock game

Add a new transaction type called `lock` that prevents any more moves being made.

### implement the storage as JSON

Change the storage schema so it uses JSON rather than CSV.

### player log

Add a log of the moves so you can see what moves were made in what order.

### leaderboard

Write a CLI function that displays the number of games won and lost by each player.

## code

Here are some pointers to the key bits of code you will need to look at to make changes.

> **NOTE** you have this code locally inside the `code/xo/src` folder

### general

 * [address library](https://github.com/catenasys/training/blob/master/code/xo/src/shared/address.js) - used to define the transaction family name and version and prefix and to generate state addresses for both the tp and client
 * [encoding library](https://github.com/catenasys/training/blob/master/code/xo/src/shared/encoding.js) - used to turn game data into CSV strings and CSV strings into game data
 * [utils](https://github.com/catenasys/training/blob/master/code/xo/src/shared/utils.js) - used to display the textual output of a game and shorted keys for display

### transaction processor

 * [payload library](https://github.com/catenasys/training/blob/master/code/xo/src/tp/payload.js) - used to process an incoming transaction payload
 * [state library](https://github.com/catenasys/training/blob/master/code/xo/src/tp/state.js) - used to read and write state to the validator
 * [handler](https://github.com/catenasys/training/blob/master/code/xo/src/tp/handler.js) - the core library used to process transactions
 * [utils](https://github.com/catenasys/training/blob/master/code/xo/src/tp/utils.js) - utils like checking if a board state currently is a win for a player and initial game state

### CLI client

 * [handlers](https://github.com/catenasys/training/blob/master/code/xo/src/cli/handlers.js) - handlers for each of the subcommands
 * [transaction](https://github.com/catenasys/training/blob/master/code/xo/src/cli/transaction.js) - used to create and sign new transactions
 * [state](https://github.com/catenasys/training/blob/master/code/xo/src/cli/transaction.js) - read state and submit transactions
 * [restapi](https://github.com/catenasys/training/blob/master/code/xo/src/cli/restapi.js) - communicate with the rest api
 * [key](https://github.com/catenasys/training/blob/master/code/xo/src/cli/key.js) - used to load keys and create signer objects for transactions
 * [formatters](https://github.com/catenasys/training/blob/master/code/xo/src/cli/formatters.js) - used to display nice text output on the console
