Keys are used to sign transactions that are sent to the sawtooth network.

A single user will have both a public and private key using the [Secp256k1](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1) elliptic curve algorithm.

When signing a new transaction - the user's private key is used to sign the transaction but that private key is never seen by the outside world.

However, the public key is visible on the blockchain and is used to verify that transactions sent by that user were in fact signed by the corresponding private key.

> When writing a production Sawtooth application - you will need a way to manage users' private keys as part of your application.  This is beyond the scope of this training but is an important part of an application stack.

## Look at the existing keys

When the `shell` container is started - it will use the `sawtooth keygen` command to generate a keypair for the root user.

Type the following to get into the shell container:

```bash
docker exec -it sawtooth-shell bash
```

The keys by default are created in the `/root/.sawtooth/keys` folder - move to that folder now:

```bash
cd /root/.sawtooth/keys
ls -la
```

This should show output like the following:

```bash
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root  136 Nov 14 08:47 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Nov 14 12:20 ..
-rw-r----- 1 root root   65 Nov 14 12:21 root.priv
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   67 Nov 14 12:21 root.pub
```

Both the private and public key are stored in hex format - you can print the contents of the keys like this:

```bash
cat root.priv
```

This should show output like the following:

```bash
1f244a4e01efe386ccdd9e2c8ebcb7b6247621609b99f6f734cb63a686672da0
```

## Creating new keys

New keys can be created using the `sawtooth keygen` command.

Let's make a new set of keys for a user called `bob`:

```bash
sawtooth keygen bob
```

This should produce output like the following:

```bash
writing file: /root/.sawtooth/keys/bob.priv
writing file: /root/.sawtooth/keys/bob.pub
```

## Recreating keys

If you want to re-generate the keys for a user - you must supply the `--force` flag to the ``sawtooth keygen` command.

Notice what happens if we try to generate keys for the bob user without using the `--force` flag:

```bash
sawtooth keygen bob
```

This should produce output like the following:

```bash
file exists: /root/.sawtooth/keys/bob.priv
file exists: /root/.sawtooth/keys/bob.pub
Error: files exist, rerun with --force to overwrite existing files
```

When we use the `--force` flag:

```bash
sawtooth keygen bob --force
```

This should produce output like the following:

```bash
overwriting file: /root/.sawtooth/keys/bob.priv
overwriting file: /root/.sawtooth/keys/bob.pub
```

## Key directory

When generating new keys - you can specify which directory they key files should be placed in.

Let's create a temporary folder and create some keys for `alice` in that folder:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/testkeys
sawtooth keygen --key-dir /tmp/testkeys alice
```

This should produce output like the following:

```bash
writing file: /tmp/testkeys/alice.priv
writing file: /tmp/testkeys/alice.pub
```

## Using keys

In order to do anything useful on a Sawtooth network, you need to submit transactions to the transaction processors.

This will involve some kind of **client**.

In actual fact, when we were playing XO in the browser earlier - we were using a client that was submitting transactions to the XO tranasction processor.

In this case - the client was running in the browser.

## Using keys in existing clients

When using transaction family clients - if you are doing anything that will need to submit a transaction, you will need a private key to sign the transaction.

For example - the xo client (which we will get to know shortly) - lets you use the `key-dir` and `key-name` arguments to specify which key files should be used when signing transactions.

## Using keys in clients that you create

When you are writing your own clients for transaction processors - you will need to load the key files choosen by the user in order to sign transactions.

How you manage these private keys is up to you but the client must have access to the private key file if you want to be able to submit transactions to your transaction processor.
