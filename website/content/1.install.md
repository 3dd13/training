Before we begin to create amazing blockchain applications - we will need to get our computers setup.

We will be developing transaction processors for Sawtooth.  To do this in development, we will be running a full sawtooth network using [docker](https://www.docker.com/).

First - we need a few tools to get setup.

## Docker Playground

The easiest way to try Sawtooth is to use the online resource [Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/).

This allows you to have a machine running in the cloud that has Docker pre-installed that you can play with.

First - visit the [Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/) homepage and click `login`.

You will need a Docker account to use this service - create a Docker account then click the `Start` button.

Once you have a screen like the following - click the `Add New Instance` button:

![play-with-docker-create](/images/screens/pwd-create.png "play-with-docker-create")

You should now have a Docker instance up and running!  Note the `SSH` field - this will allow you to login to your Docker instance from your local machine:

![play-with-docker-shell](/images/screens/pwd-shell.png "play-with-docker-shell")

Also note the `Editor` button - this will let you edit code on your instance.

## Test Docker

Let's test our Docker installation using the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm  busybox echo 'hello world'
```

> **TIP**: you can copy paste these commands using the pink circle icon on the right hand side


You might see Docker downloading image layers.  At the end of the output for this command you should see `hello world`

## Clone repository

We will make use of the various code examples used throughout these workshops.  To download the repository - run the following command in your terminal application.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/catenasys/training
cd training
```

You can view the repository [here](https://github.com/catenasys/training)
