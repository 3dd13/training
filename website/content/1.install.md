Before we begin to create amazing blockchain applications - we will need to get our computers setup.

We will be developing transaction processors for Sawtooth.  To do this in development, we will be running a full sawtooth network using [docker](https://www.docker.com/).

First - we need a few tools to get setup.

## Terminal

You will need a terminal application.  In Windows this is the `cmd` application.  On Mac and Linux, this is the `terminal` application.

## Option 1 (easy) - Docker Playground

The easiest way to try Sawtooth is to use the online resource [Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/).

This allows you to have a machine running in the cloud that has Docker pre-installed that you can play with.

First - visit the [Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/) homepage and click `login`.

You will need a Docker account to use this service - create a Docker account then click the `Start` button.

![play-with-docker-login](/images/screens/pwd-login.png "play-with-docker-login")

Once you have a screen like the following - click the `Add New Instance` button:

![play-with-docker-create](/images/screens/pwd-create.png "play-with-docker-create")

You should now have a Docker instance up and running!  Note the `SSH` field - this will allow you to login to your Docker instance from your local machine:

![play-with-docker-shell](/images/screens/pwd-shell.png "play-with-docker-shell")

Also note the `Editor` button - this will let you edit code on your instance.

### SSH

If you are using the Play with Docker approach - you will need an SSH client.  If you have a Mac or Linux machine, this should already be installed. If you have a windows machine - one of the following options should work:

 * [Install native windows 10 SSH cli](https://websiteforstudents.com/enable-windows-10-built-in-ssh-client-server/)
 * [Install Putty](https://www.putty.org/)

## Option 2 (hard) - Install Docker locally

Install both docker and docker compose onto your machine using the following links:

 * [Install Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
 * [Install Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
 * [Install Docker for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)

If you already have Docker installed on your machine - you can skip this step.

**NOTE** install the `Docker for Mac` rather than `Docker Toolbox`.

### Git

You will need git installed on your machine - this means you can clone the repository used throughout the examples.

If you do not have the `git` command installed on your machine - you need to install it:

 * [Install git for Mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
 * [Install git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
 * [Install git for Linux](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## Test Docker

From this point - both methods of installing Docker (either local or Play with Docker) will apply.

Let's test our Docker installation using the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm  busybox echo 'hello sawtooth'
```

> **TIP**: you can copy paste these commands using the pink circle icon on the right hand side


You might see Docker downloading image layers.  At the end of the output for this command you should see `hello sawtooth`

## Clone repository

We will make use of the various code examples used throughout these workshops.  To download the repository - run the following command in your terminal application.

First - make a new folder somewhere on your computer for the workshops:

```bash
mkdir workshops
cd workshops
```

Now we clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/catenasys/training
```

You can view the repository [here](https://github.com/catenasys/training)
