title: Settings Transaction Processor
order: 8
---

When you make changes to a transaction processor and the client, it might be time to push a new version to production.

Sawtooth has the ability to control which transaction processors are currently able to receive transactions.

It controls this using settings that are themselves, recorded onto the chain.

## looking at settings

Let's get ourselves into the validator container so we can run the `sawtooth` and `sawset` commands using the root validator keys.

```bash
docker exec -it sawtooth-validator bash
```

> you might first need to exit the current container using the `exit` command

Now use the `sawtooth settings list` command to view the current settings recorded on the chain:

```bash
sawtooth settings list \
  --format json \
  --url http://rest-api:8008
```

This should produce output similar to:

```bash
{
  "head": "d81a4718cd588cf172081de949ed1c10f9d5f73bddaf70eb5d4370449161b1642a06b3467ffcc1449205c7e95ff58e6b75958e94de1187419977e921fe8d7dad",
  "settings": {
    "sawtooth.settings.vote.authorized_keys": "035b0be931427f254b02a799b7fcf336ad2b894a1a9ab2a224b87b52edbb20f704"
  }
}
```

## updating settings

We will now add the `sawtooth.validator.transaction_families` value which tells the validators what transaction processors are able to process transactions.

> The settings for a sawtooth network are saved on the blockchain.  In development mode - these proposals are accepted immediately.  In a production environment, you can configure the settings transaction processor to only accept new settings on a successful vote.

Now we use the `sawset proposal create` command which will update the values of settings inside the settings tp.

The value we will update is:

```json
[{
  "family": "intkey", 
  "version": "1.0"
}, {
  "family":"sawtooth_settings", 
  "version":"1.0"
}, {
  "family":"xo", 
  "version":"1.0"
}]
```

As you can probably guess - this will allow the following transaction processors:

 * intkey - used to test a sawtooth network
 * sawtooth_settings - used to save the settings on the chain (enabled)
 * xo - used for the xo game transaction processor

Run this command inside the validator container:

```bash
sawset proposal create \
  --url http://rest-api:8008 \
  --key /root/.sawtooth/keys/my_key.priv \
  sawtooth.validator.transaction_families='[{"family": "intkey", "version": "1.0"}, {"family":"sawtooth_settings", "version":"1.0"}, {"family":"xo", "version":"1.0"}]'
```

> **NOTE** this command won't produce any output

## confirm settings

Now let's re-run our `sawtooth settings list` to confirm that setting is applied:

```bash
sawtooth settings list \
  --format json \
  --url http://rest-api:8008
```

This should produce output similar to:

```bash
{
  "head": "2d299a16af1307275422e920d38e01bc71a61e954daba2ee7ee5fd1315173cf1322fc50b8370d2fb71b43860c601c68abe9f00b6959e4cef5218484a8f7d46b4",
  "settings": {
    "sawtooth.settings.vote.authorized_keys": "035b0be931427f254b02a799b7fcf336ad2b894a1a9ab2a224b87b52edbb20f704",
    "sawtooth.validator.transaction_families": "[{\"family\": \"intkey\", \"version\": \"1.0\"}, {\"family\":\"sawtooth_settings\", \"version\":\"1.0\"}, {\"family\":\"xo\", \"version\":\"1.0\"}]"
  }
}
```

## advanced exercise

Update the XO transaction processor and client to version `1.1`.

Then update the settings to allow for xo version 1.1.

Make sure you restart the transaction processor for the change have an effect.

> HINT: the version for both client and transaction processor lives in `code/xo/src/shared/address.js`

Read about the [various settings](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/1.0.5/transaction_family_specifications/settings_transaction_family.html#settings) you can apply to a Sawtooth network.

Understand how the settings tp [executes transactions](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/1.0.5/transaction_family_specifications/settings_transaction_family.html#execution).

Finally - read the various subcommands for the `sawset` cli tool ([docs here](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/1.0/cli/sawset.html#sawset)).  These can be used to vote on settings proposals.
