Now we are going to spin up a sawtooth network.

This is a real version of the software used in production, all running locally on your machine!

## Fetch Manifests

We will use a docker compose file that contains instructions for Docker to run the various components required to run a Sawtooth network.

Make sure you have cloned the code repository from the previous page.

Then get yourself into the `code/compose` folder as follows:

```bash
cd training/code/compose
ls -la
```

You should see a `sawtooth.yaml` file in this directory.

## Components

The components we are about to run you will get to know a lot more over the next 2 days.  We are about to start:

 * **validator** - the core process of a sawtooth network - it replicates blocks to peers and validates new blocks being submitted by clients
 * **rest api** - gives a [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) interface to the validator so you can write programs that query state and submit new transactions
 * **shell** - a command line interface with various useful clients that can speak to the validator
 * **settings-tp** - a transaction processor responsible for the settings applied to the whole network of validators
 * **intkey-tp** - a transaction processor that provides functions that can be used to test deployed ledgers

The contents of this file can be seen as follows:

```yaml
version: "3.5"

  sawtooth-dev:
    name: sawtooth-dev

        \""
    # mount the key directory so we can use our keys in other containers
    volumes:
      - ./.keys:/root/.sawtooth/keys

```

> Take a look through the docker-compose file above - it is a good map of the various components needed to run a sawtooth network and how to run them.

## Run Sawtooth!

Once you are inside the directory with the `sawtooth.yaml` file - you can use the following command to boot a running sawtooth network (a single node local version but it's the same code we would run in production):

```bash
docker-compose -f sawtooth.yaml up
```

You will see various logs appearing in your console - take a look through the logs to get a sense of what is going on.

**NOTE** when you see the following output - the stack is up and running:

```bash
sawtooth-shell  | writing file: /root/.sawtooth/keys/root.priv
sawtooth-shell  | writing file: /root/.sawtooth/keys/root.pub
```

## Check Docker Status

You can check if the sawtooth containers are running using the `docker ps` command (in another terminal window):

```bash
docker ps
```

You should see output like the following:

```bash
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                   COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                              NAMES

0dd56cf94a3a        hyperledger/sawtooth-validator:1.0      "bash -c 'sawadm key…"   2 minutes ago       Up 2 minutes        0.0.0.0:4004->4004/tcp             sawtooth-validator
```

## View Logs

You can view the logs of the various components using the `docker logs` command.

To view the logs of the validator:

```bash
docker logs sawtooth-validator
```

To view the logs of the settings transaction processor:

```bash
docker logs sawtooth-settings-tp
```

> You can view the logs of any docker container you are running by first gettings it's name from `docker ps` then using the name in the logs command `docker logs <name>`

The names of the various containers are shown as follows:

 * validator = `sawtooth-validator`
 * rest-api = `sawtooth-rest-api`
 * settings-tp = `sawtooth-settings-tp`
 * intkey-tp = `sawtooth-intkey-tp-go`
 * shell = `sawtooth-shell`

> **TIP**: you can follow the logs of any of the containers using `-f` - for example to follow the logs of the validator container:

```bash
docker logs -f sawtooth-validator
```

## Restarting

To stop and remove the docker-compose containers:

```bash
docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)
```

> **TIP** you can be in any directory to run the `docker rm` command

> **NOTE** because we are in development - when you restart sawtooth, you will loose all of your state and keys because we have not mounted volumes.  

This will have removed all Docker containers from your system.  To convince yourself of this - you can list the containers:

```bash
docker ps
```

> removing the containers is important because if you restart the containers, the shell container will complain that there are existing keys

To start them again later (again, making sure you are in the `code/compose` folder - you can always return back to the original terminal window you started the stack in).

```bash
docker-compose -f sawtooth.yaml up
```

> **TIP**: if you want to start the stack in the background you can use:

```bash
docker-compose -f sawtooth.yaml up -d
```
