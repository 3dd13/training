title: Development Environment

Now we are going to spin up a sawtooth network.

This is a real version of the software used in production, all running locally on your machine!

## Fetch Manifests

We will use a docker compose file that contains instructions for Docker to run the various components required to run a Sawtooth network.

Make sure you have cloned the code repository from the previous page.

Then get yourself into the `code/compose` folder as follows:

```bash
cd code/compose
ls -la
```

You should see a `docker-compose.yaml` file in this directory.

View this file:

```bash
cat docker-compose.yaml
```

## Components

The components we are about to run you will get to know a lot more over the next 2 days.  We are about to start:

 * **validator** - the core process of a sawtooth network - it replicates blocks to peers and validates new blocks being submitted by clients
 * **rest api** - gives a [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) interface to the validator so you can write programs that query state and submit new transactions
 * **shell** - a command line interface with various useful clients that can speak to the validator
 * **settings-tp** - a transaction processor responsible for the settings applied to the whole network of validators
 * **intkey-tp** - a transaction processor that provides functions that can be used to test deployed ledgers
 * **xo-tp** - a transaction processor that will play a game of tic-tac-toe
 * **xo-ui** - a web ui for the xo transaction processor
 * **voting-tp** - a skeleton voting transaction processor we will develop in this course

The contents of this file can be seen as follows:

> Take a look through the docker-compose file above - it is a good map of the various components needed to run a sawtooth network and how to run them.

## Run Sawtooth!

Once you are inside the directory with the `sawtooth.yaml` file - you can use the following command to boot a running sawtooth network (a single node local version but it's the same code we would run in production):

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Check Docker Status

You can check if the sawtooth containers are running using the `docker ps` command (in another terminal window):

```bash
docker ps
```

You should see output like the following:

```bash
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                   COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                              NAMES

```

## View Logs

You can view the logs of the various components using the `docker logs` command.

To view the logs of the validator:

```bash
docker logs sawtooth-validator
```

You will see various logs appearing in your console - take a look through the logs to get a sense of what is going on.

Let's take a look at the logs of the shell container:

```bash
docker logs sawtooth-shell
```

**NOTE** if you see the following output - the stack is up and running:

```bash
writing file: /root/.sawtooth/keys/root.priv
writing file: /root/.sawtooth/keys/root.pub
```

To view the logs of the settings transaction processor:

```bash
docker logs sawtooth-settings-tp
```

We can see the combined logs of all components using this command:

```bash
docker-compose logs
```

> You can view the logs of any docker container you are running by first gettings it's name from `docker ps` then using the name in the logs command `docker logs <name>`

The names of the various containers are shown as follows:

 * validator = `sawtooth-validator`
 * rest-api = `sawtooth-rest-api`
 * settings-tp = `sawtooth-settings-tp`
 * intkey-tp = `sawtooth-intkey-tp-go`
 * xo-tp = `sawtooth-xo-tp`
 * voting-tp = `sawtooth-voting-tp`
 * shell = `sawtooth-shell`

> **TIP**: you can follow the logs of any of the containers using `-f` - for example to follow the logs of the validator container:

```bash
docker logs -f sawtooth-validator
```

## Restarting

To stop and remove the docker-compose containers:

```bash
docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)
```

> **TIP** you can be in any directory to run the `docker rm` command

> **NOTE** because we are in development - when you restart sawtooth, you will loose all of your state and keys because we have not mounted volumes.  

This will have removed all Docker containers from your system.  To convince yourself of this - you can list the containers:

```bash
docker ps
```

> removing the containers is important because if you restart the containers, the shell container will complain that there are existing keys

To start them again later (again, making sure you are in the `code/compose` folder - you can always return back to the original terminal window you started the stack in).

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

And check the containers are running again:

```bash
docker ps
```
