## start xo stack

Let's spin up a sawtooth stack that includes the xo-tp and xo-demo:

```bash
cd code/compose
docker-compose -f sawtooth.yaml -f xo.yaml up
```

## looking at settings

Before we can actually use our transaction processor - we will need to tell the settings tp that `xo` family transactions are allowed on the chain.

To do this - we the `sawset proposal create` tool inside the validator container.

This tool makes proposals to the settings tp which if accepted - will update the settings applied to the network.

Let's get ourselves into the validator container so we can run the `sawset` command:

```bash
docker exec -it sawtooth-validator-default bash
```

Now use the `sawtooth settings list` command to view the current settings recorded on the chain:

```bash
sawtooth settings list \
  --format json \
  --url http://rest-api:8008
```

This should produce output similar to:

```bash
{
  "head": "d81a4718cd588cf172081de949ed1c10f9d5f73bddaf70eb5d4370449161b1642a06b3467ffcc1449205c7e95ff58e6b75958e94de1187419977e921fe8d7dad",
  "settings": {
    "sawtooth.settings.vote.authorized_keys": "035b0be931427f254b02a799b7fcf336ad2b894a1a9ab2a224b87b52edbb20f704"
  }
}
```

## updating settings

We need to add the `sawtooth.validator.transaction_families` value which tells the validators what transaction processors are able to process transactions.

> The settings for a sawtooth network are saved on the blockchain.  In development mode - these proposals are accepted immediately.  In a production environment, you can configure the settings transaction processor to only accept new settings on a succesful vote.

Now we use the `sawset proposal create` command which will update the values of settings inside the settings tp.

The value we will update is:

```json
[{
  "family": "intkey", 
  "version": "1.0"
}, {
  "family":"sawtooth_settings", 
  "version":"1.0"
}, {
  "family":"xo", 
  "version":"1.0"
}]
```

As you can probably guess - this will active the following transaction processors:

 * intkey - used to test a sawtooth network
 * sawtooth_settings - used to save the settings on the chain (enabled)
 * xo - used for the xo game transaction processor

```bash
sawset proposal create \
  --url http://rest-api:8008 \
  --key /root/.sawtooth/keys/my_key.priv \
  sawtooth.validator.transaction_families='[{"family": "intkey", "version": "1.0"}, {"family":"sawtooth_settings", "version":"1.0"}, {"family":"xo", "version":"1.0"}]'
```

## confirm settings

Now let's re-run our `sawtooth settings list` to confirm that setting is applied:

```bash
sawtooth settings list \
  --format json \
  --url http://rest-api:8008
```

This should produce output similar to:

```bash
{
  "head": "2d299a16af1307275422e920d38e01bc71a61e954daba2ee7ee5fd1315173cf1322fc50b8370d2fb71b43860c601c68abe9f00b6959e4cef5218484a8f7d46b4",
  "settings": {
    "sawtooth.settings.vote.authorized_keys": "035b0be931427f254b02a799b7fcf336ad2b894a1a9ab2a224b87b52edbb20f704",
    "sawtooth.validator.transaction_families": "[{\"family\": \"intkey\", \"version\": \"1.0\"}, {\"family\":\"sawtooth_settings\", \"version\":\"1.0\"}, {\"family\":\"xo\", \"version\":\"1.0\"}]"
  }
}
```

## advanced exercise

First - read about the [various settings](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/1.0.5/transaction_family_specifications/settings_transaction_family.html#settings) you can apply to a Sawtooth network.

Understand how the [settings tp executes](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/1.0.5/transaction_family_specifications/settings_transaction_family.html#execution).
