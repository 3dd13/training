## Let's play a game!

Now that we have a running xo transaction processor - let's play a game of XO!

To make it easier - we have a nice browser UI that communicates with the transaction processor.

It's already running - open the following address in your browser: [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)

## Create a game

Click `Create` and name your game.

> Notice how when the game is created - the transaction processor will produce some output

## Play the game

Play the game by clicking around.

> Notice how the transaction processor is printing the status of the game as you play

## Create an error

Try clicking on a space that is already taken.

> Notice how the transaction processor will reject the transaction and the message is displayed in both the logs of the transaction processor and the UI

## Play multiplayer

Let's try some multiplayer action!

First - you will need to find out your IP address.

This is usually done by using the `ifconfig` command.

Try to find the IP address of your machine on the wireless network you have joined and give it to someone else.

If the IP address is `192.168.1.91` then the URL they should enter would be `http://192.168.1.91:8081`

> Notice how you cannot move if it's not your turn

## advanced exercise

Using the CLI commands we learned earlier - examine the status of the transactions that were produced in the browser as you played the game.
